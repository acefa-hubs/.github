We are the **Australian Consortium for Epidemic Forecasting & Analytics**. Our goal is to support the timely, effective response to epidemic diseases in Australia through real-time data analytics, modelling, and forecasting.

Our key activities:
- **Decision support**: Generate and share real-time analyses with Australian decision-makers and the public.
- **Methods and tools**: Advance methods and software tools for epidemic analysis.
- **Data**: Inform the design of surveillance studies to optimise data collection for public health action.
- **Engagement**: Develop and maintain a community of practice among key stakeholders including public health decision-makers and practitioners, academic researchers, and surveillance system leads.

ACEFA involves multiple academic research groups from across Australia including the [Infectious Disease Dynamics Unit](https://mspgh.unimelb.edu.au/research-groups/centre-for-epidemiology-and-biostatistics-research/infectious-disease-dynamics) at the University of Melbourne, [Infectious Disease Ecology and Modelling group](https://www.telethonkids.org.au/our-research/brain-and-behaviour/child-health-analytics-research-program/infectious-disease-ecology-and-modelling/) at Telethon Kids Institute, [Defence Science and Technology Group](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/), and colleagues at Monash University, University of New South Wales, Australian National University, James Cook University, and the University of Adelaide. The consortium's work builds on a national seasonal influenza forecasting program (2014–19) and [COVID-19 situational assessment consortium (2020–23)](https://doi.org/10.26188/24845328.v1).
